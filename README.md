Early attempt at understanding how to build a complete program (rather than the single functions producing a simple output that I had studied to this point when I created this).

This version is a more-or-less fully functional Battleships game (human vs "AI") that can be played in the console of your IDE.

The "AI" is very basic, however, it will evaluate likely coordinates to attack, prioritising those adjacent to hits, and looking for likely spaces in between taken shots where undiscovered ships may be.

Ship placement is random for both players, with validation to ensure no overlaps.

**I hadn't yet learned how to design using Object Oriented Programming when I made this - the structure makes little to no sense. At some point I intend on rebuilding it using OOP principles.**
